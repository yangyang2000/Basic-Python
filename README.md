# Basic-Python

This notebook will introduce you to programming in Python, and using the Jupyter Notebook environment. Just download the notebook, create a folder in the same directory called "figures" and work your way through the code. Things we cover:

0. Python/Jupyter basics including MarkDown/Mathjax
1. Data types
2. Boolean logic
3. Flow control (for/while loops, if statements)
4. Functions
5. Pandas basics (reading csv files, manipulating data frames, groupby summaries)
6. Matplotlib basics (making plots, saving plots)
7. Merging concepts
8. Basic analysis (OLS with Statsmodels and Sklearn)

Note that errors in the code are deliberate for illustration.
